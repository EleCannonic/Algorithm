# Algorithm

This repository contains algorithms frequently used in mathematical modeling, data processing, machine learning, etc. 

This repository contains a collection of common algorithms with their mathematical descriptions and implementations in both MATLAB and Python. The goal of this project is to provide a resource for students, researchers, and engineers who need quick access to algorithmic solutions and their theoretical foundations.

We update this project non-scheduled. 

# Content
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA), MATLAB

# How to Use
All codes in this repository are all packaged functions or classes. For each algorithms we provided a simple test example in the end of the description markdown document, along with their output results. These examples may help you to have a brief impress of the output and check if your data produces a correct result.

(I'm just an undergraduate. If there is errors, feel free to raise issue.)
